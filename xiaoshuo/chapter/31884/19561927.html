I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend...\u0026#34;\u0026#34;He has no way of guessing the danger,\u0026#34; I said to myself. \u0026#34;He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs...\u0026#34;But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:\u0026#34;I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well...\u0026#34;I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory:\u0026#34;Then you are thirsty, too\u0026#34; I demanded.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:\u0026#34;Water may also be good for the heart...\u0026#34;I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:\u0026#34;The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.\u0026#34;I replied, \u0026#34;Yes, that is so.\u0026#34; And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     \u0026#34;The desert is beautiful,\u0026#34; the little prince added.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams...\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     \u0026#34;What makes the desert beautiful,\u0026#34; said the little prince, \u0026#34;is that somewhere it hides a well...\u0026#34;I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     \u0026#34;Yes,\u0026#34; I said to the little prince. \u0026#34;The house, the stars, the desert— what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!\u0026#34;\u0026#34;I am glad,\u0026#34; he said, \u0026#34;that you agree with my fox.\u0026#34;As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \u0026#34;What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...\u0026#34;As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \u0026#34;What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower— the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep...\u0026#34; And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.","cnt":0,"sort":19561927,"author":"圣埃克苏佩里（法）","prev":"19561926.html","next":"19561928.html","book_title":"小王子","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-31 13:17:55","category":"都市小说"}
